// "With the help of Sri Sri, we have placed our spirit to achieve reconciliation and coexistence of a big and benevolent country, whose destiny canâ€™t be that of the war. The teachings of the Art of Living are essential to achieve a stable and long-lasting peace."

// One year later, yesterday, the peace pact has been signed. Gurudev Sri Sri Ravi Shankar on Wednesday congratulated Juan Manuel Santos, the Colombian President and Marcos Carratala, the FARC negotiator for announcing a bilateral ceasefire.

// During last one year, Sri Sri had meetings and dialogues with both parties (See the timeline below). He taught his stress-elimination techniques to members of the Colombian government as well as the FARC that gave them the experience of peace and struck a chord within them.
